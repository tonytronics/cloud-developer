Note
for secrets I installed the dotenv module
and created a .env file in the root of the project to contain 
all the configuration settings
alternatively on the mac we have the ~/.zshrc file which our terminal runs 
this can be used in place of .env 
the variables are accessed in node via process.env 

To deploy to EBS 
npm run build 
eb create  

* after making changes use this command to update code
eb deploy
